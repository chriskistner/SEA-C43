		<h2> About My Game Monty Python Game
		</br>Updated: 8/10/15 </h2>
		<p> I've been trying to use javascript to create an interactive text-based advanture as you lead Arthur and his knights on his quest for the holy grail. This is actually really hard and I'm still getting the basics of Javascript down but I hope to have the whole quest programmed by the end of this course.</article>

		<h2> Me and Monty Python over the Years
			</br>Updated: 8/9/15 </h2>
		<p> I've been a big Monty Python fan ever since I first watched flying circus when I was 10. Since then I've colletced their entire catalogue of works on DVD> I find British humor very appealing for some reason though It's very hard to explain to someone who's not into it why.</article>

		<h2> My Career Goals 
		</br>Updated: 8/8/15 </h2>
		<p> I want to become a programmer because it's a challenge, I've been doing marketing and sales for over 10 years now and to be blunt, I'm bored. Looking forward to studying a subject matter that's going to kick me in the teeth and force me to focus every now and again.</article>

		<h2> About Me! </br>Updated: 8/7/15 </h2>
		<p> I've been a Seattle native since I was 1o years old. My family moved here from California in 1992. Since then I've lived in Maple Valley, Kent, Renton, Auburn, and Seattle at various points in my life. Never for too long, but always in King County. </article>
